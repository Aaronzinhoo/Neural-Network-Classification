# Neural-Network-Classification
An attempt to implement a Neural Network and test it on the Caltech101_silhouettes dataset

Neural Networks are known as powerful tools used by the machine learning community to tackle hard problems such as image segmentation, classification, and evn nonlinear regression. The drawback to this powerful tool is the scalability of parameters, since they grow increasing large with the addition of layers and increasing the size of the layers. The other problem with the neural network is that anything we are able to predict and achieve is uninterpretable due to the black box that the feed-forward and backpropagation algorithms create. This 'black-box' makes it hard to use the neural net when analysis of results is crucial. On the positive side though they offer much customiization and parameters to tackle most challenges. Future work includes trying to implement a convolutional neural network which runs into similar problems as the neural network, but is much more powerful.
